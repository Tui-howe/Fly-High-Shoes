# This is Basketball shoe/Singlet Website Project

### About my project
My Project is about Basketball shoes and other gear needed to play basketball such as Jerseys (Basketbal term for Singlets) and more. I was always inspired by footlocker and had hoped to create my own shoe store one day and so it has been real fun designing my dream website. 

Basketball shoes are very important because it protects players from possibly getting injured, They also look cool and anyone can wear them not just ballers. There are so many different styles of shoes so any customer has tonnes of options to pick from

### The Design
* Colour
  * The reason for picking these colour as the homepage: It was because basketball shoes come in all colours and so i chose gold and black to make sure the focus is on the shoes
* Layout: The layout was based off websites like Footlocker
* Font styles: I used fonts such as Helvetica and Arial
* Media: i had a lot inspiration from websites like Footlocker and Nike.

### What Browser work and how they find the website
* FireFox: Loaded the website smoothly, images were much clearer and brighter, the links were loading in pretty quickley
* Google Chrome: loaded pretty smoothly, images were clear but had a small blur when first loaded in, the links loaded in pretty quickley.
* Microsft Edge: Loaded in pretty smoothly, images were clear but had a quite a bit of blur surronding the actual images, the links also loaded pretty quickley
