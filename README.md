# This is Basketball shoe Project

### About my project
My Project is about Basketball shoes and other gear needed to play basketball such as Jerseys (Basketbal term for Singlets) and more. I was always inspired by footlocker and had hoped to create my own shoe store one day and so it has been real fun designing my dream website. 

Basketball shoes are very important because it protects players from possibly getting injured, They also look cool and anyone can wear them not just ballers. There are so many different styles of shoes so any customer has tonnes of options to pick from

### The Design
*** Colour**
  * The reason for picking the colour os the homepage: It was because basketball shoes come in all colours and so i chose gold and black to make sure the focus is on the shoes
* Layout: The layout was based off websites like Footlocker
* Font styles: I just used the most generic fonts such as Helvetica and Arial
* Media: i had a lot inspiration from websites like Footlocker and Nike.
